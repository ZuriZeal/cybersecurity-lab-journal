# Cybersecurity Projects

This folder contains my larger cybersecurity setups and long-term projects.

Examples include:
- Wazuh home lab
- Splunk monitoring setup
- Windows and Linux security labs
- Network scanning and monitoring projects

Each project will have its own folder with:
- Setup steps
- Tools used
- Screenshots or outputs
- Findings and lessons learned
