# Firewall Lab – 2026-01-19

## Goal
Test how firewall rules control attack surface.

## Tools
- Ubuntu VM
- UFW firewall
- Nmap from host machine

## Steps
1. Enabled UFW with default deny incoming
2. Scanned VM from host
3. Allowed SSH only
4. Scanned again
5. Observed ping blocking behavior

## Findings
- Default deny blocked all ports
- Allowing SSH exposed only port 22
- Firewall blocked ping, making host appear “down”
- Nmap required -Pn to scan

## What I Learned
- Firewalls enforce security policy
- Services alone don’t control exposure—rules do
- Blocking ICMP increases stealth
- Scans validate firewall behavior
